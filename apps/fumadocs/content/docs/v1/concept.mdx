## Overview

### Purpose

The goal is to build a web application that enables users to create and manage hiring processes, with the ability to track multiple interview sessions within each process.

### Core Features

**Hiring Process Management:**

- Define and track hiring processes (job applications) with various statuses (e.g., ongoing, rejected, dropped-out, hired, etc.)
- Each hiring process can contain multiple interview sessions (prepared for future implementation)
- Store comprehensive company information including: salary, benefits, location, name, website, and contact details

**Interaction Tracking:**
With that information, we want to be able to create a list of meetings related to those hiring processes, or to be precise, a list of steps related to the hiring process. For example:

- If we were contacted from LinkedIn, Gmail, Facebook, etc.
- If we had a call with HR (RRHH - Recursos Humanos)
- If we had a technical challenge
- If we were hired
- If we dropped out
- If we received an email, we should be able to store the email content and the sender information

### Target Audience

- **Primary Users:** Job seekers actively applying to multiple companies
- **Use Cases:** Track applications, manage interview schedules, record interactions, organize company information

### Success Metrics

- User can create and track multiple hiring processes
- All company information is stored in one centralized location
- Users can quickly access historical interactions with companies
- Reduced time spent managing job applications by 50%
