## Overview

### Purpose

The goal is to build a web application that enables users to create and manage hiring processes, with the ability to track multiple interview sessions within each process.

### Core Features

**Hiring Process Management:**

- Define and track hiring processes (job applications) with various statuses (e.g., ongoing, rejected, dropped-out, hired, etc.)
- Each hiring process can contain multiple interview sessions (prepared for future implementation)
- Store comprehensive company information including: salary, benefits, location, name, website, and contact details

**Interaction Tracking:**
A comprehensive system for recording and organizing all communications and activities throughout the hiring process. Users can create chronological interaction notes with markdown formatting, categorize interactions by type (Email, Call, Meeting, Technical Challenge, etc.), and maintain a complete history of all touchpoints with companies.

Key capabilities include:
- Create a chronological timeline of all interactions (meetings, calls, emails, challenges, etc.)
- Track where initial contact was made (LinkedIn, Gmail, Facebook, etc.)
- Record HR calls, technical challenges, and interview sessions
- Store email content and sender information
- Document offer details, negotiations, and outcomes
- Use markdown formatting for rich, detailed notes
- Chat-style interface for quick note-taking

*For detailed specifications, see the [Interaction Tracking System](#interaction-tracking-system) section.*

### Target Audience

- **Primary Users:** Job seekers actively applying to multiple companies
- **Use Cases:** Track applications, manage interview schedules, record interactions, organize company information

### Success Metrics

- User can create and track multiple hiring processes

## Interaction Tracking System

### Overview

The Interaction Tracking system enables users to maintain a comprehensive chronological record of all communications and activities related to each hiring process. This feature transforms the detail view into a powerful note-taking and history-tracking tool, similar to a chat interface or project management timeline.

### Purpose

**Primary Goals:**

- Capture every touchpoint with a company throughout the hiring process
- Maintain a searchable history of all interactions
- Enable quick note-taking with rich text formatting
- Provide context for decision-making and follow-ups
- Track progress through interview stages

**Key Benefits:**

- Never lose track of important conversation details
- Quick reference to previous interactions before calls or meetings
- Document technical challenges and their outcomes
- Record salary negotiations and offer details
- Maintain professional relationship history

### Interaction Types

The system supports multiple interaction types to categorize different forms of communication:

| Type                | Description                                                                 | Common Use Cases                                    |

```typescript
// List interactions for a hiring process
GET /api/hiring-processes/:id/interactions
  Query params: ?type=email&limit=50&offset=0

// Create new interaction
POST /api/hiring-processes/:id/interactions
  Body: { title?, type?, content }

// Get single interaction
GET /api/interactions/:id

// Update interaction
PUT /api/interactions/:id
  Body: { title?, type?, content }

// Delete interaction
DELETE /api/interactions/:id
```

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Pagination for large interaction lists
- Caching of rendered markdown
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Batch operations for bulk edits

### Integration with Hiring Process

**Relationship:**

- Interactions are tightly coupled to hiring processes
- Deleting a hiring process cascades to delete all interactions
- Interactions provide context for status changes
- Timeline helps track progress through interview stages
