# Epic 1: Interview Management - Implementation Summary

**Implementation Date:** December 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅

- ✅ Created `packages/db/src/schema/interview.ts` with complete interview schema
- ✅ Added relations between interview and user tables
- ✅ Exported TypeScript types for type safety
- ✅ Updated schema index to export interview schema

**Schema Details:**

- `id`: UUID primary key
- `companyName`: Required text field
- `status`: Enum (ongoing, rejected, dropped-out, hired)
- `salary`: Optional integer (USD)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Automatic timestamps
- `userId`: Foreign key to user table with cascade delete

### Phase 2: Backend API ✅

- ✅ Removed ORPC dependencies from server
- ✅ Created `apps/server/src/routes/interviews.ts` with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Integrated interview routes into main Elysia app
- ✅ Updated CORS to support PUT and DELETE methods
- ✅ Implemented authentication checks using Better-Auth

**API Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/interviews` - List all user's interviews
- `GET /api/interviews/:id` - Get single interview
- `POST /api/interviews` - Create new interview
- `PUT /api/interviews/:id` - Update interview
- `DELETE /api/interviews/:id` - Delete interview

**Security:**

- All routes require authentication
- Users can only access their own interviews
- Proper error handling with 401/404 responses

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation ✅

- ✅ Created type-safe hooks with Eden Treaty
- ✅ Built reusable UI components
- ✅ Implemented all CRUD pages
- ✅ Added navigation links
- ✅ Removed ORPC dependencies from web app
- ✅ Updated UI components to use shadcn default rounded corners (rounded-md)

**Hooks Created:**

- `useInterviews()` - Fetch all interviews
- `useInterview(id)` - Fetch single interview
- `useCreateInterview()` - Create mutation
- `useUpdateInterview()` - Update mutation
- `useDeleteInterview()` - Delete mutation

**UI Components:**

- `StatusBadge` - Visual status indicator with color coding
- `DeleteConfirmDialog` - Confirmation modal for deletions
- `InterviewForm` - Shared form for create/edit with validation
- `InterviewTable` - Data table with sorting and actions

**Pages:**

- `/interviews` - Dashboard with list, filter, sort
- `/interviews/new` - Create new interview form
- `/interviews/:id` - Interview detail view
- `/interviews/:id/edit` - Edit interview form

### Phase 4: Code Cleanup ✅

- ✅ Removed ORPC packages from `apps/server/package.json`
- ✅ Removed ORPC packages from `apps/web/package.json`
- ✅ Removed `utils/orpc.ts` file (replaced with `lib/query-client.ts`)
- ✅ Updated router context to use new query-client
- ✅ Updated home page to use Eden Treaty
- ✅ Added interviews link to navigation
- ✅ Updated all UI components to use shadcn default rounded corners
